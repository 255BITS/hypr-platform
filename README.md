# kotlin-spark-template
This is a template project with all the necessary dependencies and set up for a Spark web application, using Kotlin with KotlinTest

Note that I've chosen to use Spark Java, not Spark Kotlin.  The Kotlin variant is currently immature, and I find the Java version "kotliny" enough that it doesn't get it the way.
